# Sentimental-analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews using RNN Models: GRUs and LSTMs


This notebook is aimed at using Recurrent Neural Network architectures like GRU(s): Gated Recurrent Units and LSTM(s): Long Short Term Memory which is a special case of GRU, to contrast the working & accuracies between the two and to project their working domains. This is a kaggle challenge Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn. Basic goal of the challenge is to predict sentiments from the given reviews about movies. The dataset from IMDB is used for training of the neural network.
